# UV-5R-VFO-Unlock
Depreciated Software to Patch UV5R handheld Radios

This is a basic software application that was originally used to unlock the UV5R's VFO keypad.
Thus allowing you to tune out of band frequencies on the hand held.

The functionality is now built-in to software like Chirp and this is no-longer nessary.
The software was written in Ruby and I had to reverse a bit of the serial communication between the computer and the radio
while it was being programmed to see where I had to inject my own commands to the radio.

I have re-uploaded it to github as an archive. It does however still work just fine if you would like to use it on one of these older models.

I hold no responsibility or liability, don't go unlocking your radio and getting on frequencies you are not authorized to be on.
When you get caught it's on you.
